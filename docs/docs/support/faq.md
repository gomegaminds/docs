# FAQ

## Not Receiving Confirmation Emails?

In some instances, your schoolâ€™s email server may block our confirmation email requests.

If you are not receiving confirmation emails, the first thing to do is to double check your email spelling and your spam folder. 
If you are still not receiving the email, Notify your IT team and tell them that you are trying to register and receive email from mail.megaminds.world.

Alternatively, you may try creating an account with another email that is not your school email (like a gmail account).
