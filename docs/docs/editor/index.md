# Introduction 

## Before we start creating
If you did not already, it might be useful that you familiarize yourself with the [concept of classrooms](/docs/dashboard/classrooms) before using the editor.

## Role of Classroom Editor

Adding content and customizing your classrooms all happen in the Classroom Editor. All new classrooms start off empty, and is the blank canvas for you to start shaping the classroom that your students will experience.

The Classroom Editor simply put allows you to add content and a variety of useful components to your classroom.
