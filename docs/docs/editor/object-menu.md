### Quick Actions

#### Place

This button will allow you to place your object on any wall in your virtual classroom. It will reveal a sub menu where you can select the exact placement.

#### Straighten

This button will automatically straighten the object vertically.

#### Face Me

The Face Me button will angle the object towards your avatar, no matter where it is in the classroom.

#### Flip

The Flip buttons will flip the object vertically or horizontally.

### Manipulate

Here you can control the scale and rotation of your object through the sliders and buttons. Because we are manipulating objects in 3D space, you can control them across the x, y and z axis.

The Nudge controls allow you to finetune your object’s positioning.

### Interactivity

#### Auto Rotate

Clicking the Auto Rotate checkbox will start rotating your object 360 degrees continously. You can control the speed of the object rotation through the slider.

#### Allow Student Movement

Every object you place in the classroom is automatically locked and cannot be manipulated by students unless you check the ‘Allow this object to be moved by students’ box. This will allow the object to be manipulated by students during your class session.

Once a room is empty of users, the objects will return to their original positions, as Students cannot make permanent changes. 

### Other

#### Delete Object

The Delete button will remove the object permanently from the room.

#### Inspect

The Inspect button will focus your camera and pan it to an object, giving you a 360 degree view of your object.
