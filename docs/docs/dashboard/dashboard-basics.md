# Introduction

The MegaMinds Dashboard is a website where you can manage all your classrooms, see student submissions, resources, and more. In the future we have planned to add statistics, real-time status of classrooms, scheduling, and much more. 

## One minute overview

The Dashboard contains three main pages: [Dashboard](dashboard.md), [Classrooms](classrooms.md) and [Worlds](worlds.md).  

### Dashboard
The **Dashboard tab** acts as a landing page and contains resources to help you get started with MegaMinds.

For more information about the dashboard tab, click [here to go to the Dashboard documentation page](dashboard.md)

### Classrooms
The **Classrooms tab** is where you can list, edit and create new virtual classrooms for your students to explore.

For more information about the Classrooms and the Classroom tab, click [here to go to the Classroom documentation page](classrooms.md)

### Worlds
Worlds are the base 3D models that you will select from to create your virtual classrooms. We will be releasing more Worlds in future updates that are themed around different subjects and activities. Stay tuned!
