# Classrooms

The **Classrooms tab** is where you can list, edit and create new virtual classrooms for your students to explore.

## What is a classroom

A classroom is a virtual 3D environment where teachers, students (and technically any other user you would like to invite) can participate as avatars.

Once a classroom is created, it is listed on your Classrooms page and can be accessed 24/7 - making them suitable for both in-class activity, virtual lessons, and homework assignment.

It is up to the teacher to decide how the classroom is used. If the classroom will be used asynchronously (let students participate without intervention, for example through exploring), teachers can fill it with assignments and exploratory content, or for synchronous useage (where a teacher for example does a live lecture with their students), place relevant content and presentations in the 3D world.

For more information about potential use cases and applications, check out our [Teacher Hub](https://www.notion.so/Teacher-Hub-9a92e4b85edf4a14adec4f65bd40ba44)

In the dashboard, your classrooms are represented with a card that looks like this:
