# Teaching With MegaMinds

Perhaps one of the most useful things is that the virtual classrooms you create are persistent and can be experienced by your students synchronously or asynchronously. And at any time during the day.

This gives you complete flexibility with how you can use your lessons. 

Use MegaMinds in class to supercharge engagement, or assign it as homework for flipped model learning, or use it as a digital classroom extension or as a repository for your content so that your students can visit and revisit your lesson as needed throughout the year. 

The pedagogical opportunities are quite vast, and we’re excited to see how you use the platform.

## Collaborative Learning

Students have full control over their avatars, which combined with our multi-user immersive virtual environments make for an ideal setup for collaborative learning. Co-experience of 3D learning content enables social interactions that are authentic to Gens Z & Alpha.

The collaborative environments are also an ideal place to teach 21st century skills and for social-emotional activities.

## Pedagogical Flexibility

Since Classrooms can be used synchronously or asynchronously, in-person or remote, you have an unprecedented amount of pedagogical flexibility.

## Gamified Assessments

Conduct Gamified Assessments with our assessment tools. Utilize the ‘Add Question’ button in the Classroom Editor to strategically leave assessments around the classroom. Have your students take screen shots to capture their work with the Student Tools button.
