# Welcome to the Teacher Hub

A space to find everything you need as a MegaMinds teacher.

MegaMinds is a social learning platform that utilizes gamified virtual worlds and simple creation tools to empower teachers and engage students. 

With MegaMinds you can easily customize your own educational worlds with your existing teaching content and activities.  Your students can use your worlds synchronously or asynchronously, it’s completely up to you. 

MegaMinds runs in the browser of any device, and you can invite your students with a simple link—no installation or downloads are required.  A laptop, like a Chromebook, is recommended for maximum interactivity.

As with any Beta, our platform is a work-in-progress, and we would love to hear your feedback or suggestions!
